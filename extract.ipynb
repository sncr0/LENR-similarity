This paper deals with thepalladium–deuteride (PdD) structure that is generally modeled with a deuterium-to-helium (D + D⇒4He) cold-fusion process.How this process results in transmutation is based on the extended-lochon model that predicts deep-orbit electrons that are tightlybound to the4He nucleus and thus make the equivalent of a neutralized alpha particle. This model is compared with the NiH system(H + H⇒D, H##2, or 2H#)described earlier and distinguishes long-range from short-range transmutation (distance from the fusionsite) as well as the relative excess energies from fusion vs. transmutation. The model predicts the probable transmutation process(es)and products in the palladium system and explains other observed results of cold-fusion experiments.© 2015 ISCMNS. All rights reserved.

These species are connected with dissociation of the initialPMMA.The interaction of HHP with thin Ni-foil target (width 0.1÷1 mm) has been studied in this work. HHP- jet heats, melts andevaporates this thin Ni-foil target. In a result of this interaction a small hole with diameter 1–3 mm in the Ni-foil target was burnedby HHP-jet. Parameters of this hole were measured. Ni-foil weight was measured before and after the experiment also.

       " 'doc22.pdf': ': Direct decomposition of water is very difficult in normal conditions. Hydrogen gas can be usually obtained by electrolysis or by a pyrolysis reaction at high temperatures, starting at approximately 3700ºC. However, as we have already reported, anomalous heat generation can occur during plasma electrolysis, and this process makes it rather easy to achieve both electrolysis and pyrolysis simultaneously. In this paper we describe anomalous amounts of hydrogen and oxygen gas generated during plasma electrolysis. The generation of hydrogen far in excess of amounts predicted by Faraday’s law is continuously observed when conditions such as temperature, current density, input voltage and electrode surface are suitable. Non-Faraday generation of hydrogen gas sometimes produces more than 80 times as much hydrogen as normal electrolysis does. Unfortunately there have been few claimed replications of excess hydrogen, even in rare cases in which excess heat is claimed. In most cases, no excess heat or hydrogen is observed. The reaction products found after electrolysis were different after excess heat generation.  Key words: plasma electrolysis, pyrolysis, hydrogen generation, transmutation 1. ',\n",

This behavior of the effective potential in the deuterium plasma can be\\nregarded as a counterpart of the Friedel oscillations of the electron gas at zero\\ntemp erature. Because of this attractive potential, there are bound states for the\\ndeuteron pairs as well as for the surface atoms and deuterons. In these bound\\nstates the equilibrium distance between the nuclei is of the order 0.15 -0.2Å\\ndepending on the num ber density of deuterons.

       " 'doc1.pdf': 'The study of the Fleischmann–Pons Effect (FPE), i.e. the production of excess power production during electrochemical loadingof deuterium in palladium (in the past labeled cold fusion) has had a notably multidisciplinary character, involving solid state andnuclear physics, material science, electrochemistry and other ﬁelds. Correlations between the material status and the occurrence ofthe effect as well as some changes in the electrochemical interface status have been observed. Although during the last two decades,in several calorimetric experiments the effect was observed to be well above the measurement uncertainty, the mechanism producingthe excess power is not completely understood. So far, the lack of reproducibility has been responsible for the absence of a clearexplanation of the phenomenon based on experimental apparatus designed to enhance the spectrum of information required todeﬁne the effect. Recently, In order to improve this aspect of this research, speciﬁc work has been carried out to investigate whetherthe excess power was produced concurrently with the emission of Radio Frequency from the active cathode. Suitable probesand triggering included in the RF experimental system revealed RF signal emission during electrochemical loading of palladiumsamples, and a correlation between the heat production, in active samples, and RF signal emission was found. The preliminaryresults highlight the importance of performing studies on the electrodynamic effects that may be involved in the phenomenon, andthe importance of the design of appropriate instruments designed to investigate unexplored regions of metal hydrogen systems.c/circlecopyrt2016 ISCMNS.

Another wide peak with over twice of the beam energy has been measured in experiment with low beam density. This peak located between 16 and 30 KeV, and its peak position grew with the growth of integrated implantation dose (implantation time).

The di-neutron-phonon mech-anism fully accounts for the following: (1) the evolved heat commensurate with4He production, (2) the production of tritium whensmall amounts of1H are present, (3) the release of feeble neutrons, (4) the formation of Pr when Cs is present, (5) the ostensiveintermittent reproducibility and erratic (chaotic) heat out-puts, and (6) the seemingly major problem of obfuscating the Coulombicrepulsion issue. Indeed, the antics of the di-neutron can fully explain the important aspects of normal temperature LENR heateffects and transmutations. Further, the di-neutron paradigm (mechanism) falls within the normal bounds of the Standard Model,and it is without the necessity of exotic forms of matter.c/circlecopyrt2019 ISCMNS.

X-ray, Y ray, charged particle and neutron ware measured simultaneously. A series of anomalous experimental phenomena ware observed. A clear peak at 3.2MeVwas observed, when a pre-loading 1iDx was applied. This peak became evidently, following the implantation dose. Therefore, it is considered as the alpha peak from D-T secondary reaction. Its maximum ratio to D-D reaction reached 0.0015. This ratio was much higher than prediction value based on the secondary reaction of D-D fusion. Some unknown high energy counts locatedfrom 3.5MeVto 17MeVin charged particle spectra has been observed for many times. Sometimes the counts concentrated in limited area, which appeared like a peak but poor statistics. The phenomena were dij]icult to be reproduced. In the X-ray spectra, there were many characteristic peaks from Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Zr, Ru, Pd etc elements. The gamma radiation up to 30MeV was measured with a HpGe detector. Comparing to background, the intensity of foreground was a few orders higher.

ISSN 2227-3123Keywords:LENR, Surface, Theory, Transmutation, WKB approximationThe Condensed Matter Nuclear Science has been studied for the last 26 years since the original work by Fleis-chmann and Pons [1]. While the cold fusion of two deuterium atom may be more important from the technologicalpoint of view, the transmutation reactions are scientiﬁcally more interesting. The existence of low energy transmutationreactions is intrinsically even more surprising than the cold (low energy) deuterium fusion, because the low tunnelingprobability (the Gamow factor) is supposed to suppress very effectively the transition rate with the increasing nuclearcharge.In this note, transmutation reactions will be studied theoretically. In what follows we shall assume that there issome kind of mechanism, which greatly enhances the apparently small tunneling probability. We will not make anyrestrictive assumptions about the actual mechanism, except just assuming that the mechanismitselfis independent ofthe nuclear charge Z.The reported experiments show a very large variety in the transmutation products [2,3]. Not only the products,but also the methods and materials by which transmutation had been found, have a large variety [4,5]. Among allthe published transmutation studies the most prominent are those by Iwamura et al. [6,7]. The interpretation of theexperimental results allowed them to propose the existence of the following reactions:4D+13355Cs→14159Pr+ 50.49MeV(1)and6D+13856Ba→15062Sm+ 67.61MeV.(2)∗E-mail: tuomo.toimela@vamk.ﬁc/circlecopyrt2016 ISCMNS.

Application of RF to LENRelectrochemical cells in the mid-1990s clearly showed increases in the production of excess power. More recently, RF have beenmeasured in LENR cells. However, it is still possible that those data are artifacts of the operation of the system, and not indicative ofLENR. It has been suggested that the appearance of RF in LENR experiments is the cause of LENR, and not merely a manifestationof such reactions. That possibility has signiﬁcant implications.

After being precharged, the cell was driven to boiling three times the last of which continued for about 16 hours to almost dryness. The burst occurred just during the calm period about 6 hours after the first boiling. The temperature of the cell, about 100 ml in volume, increased by 7.5 Kin 13 minutes. A palladium cathode, 2mm¢> x 7.05mm, was a heat source, although the mechanism of the heat generation is still uncertain. During the whole period of this run, however, the phenomenon took place only once. Neither increase of neutron emission nor that of tritium concentration has been detected. Mass analysis showed that any traces of D2 as well as 4He have notremained in the Pd sample used.

       "'The study of the Fleischmann–Pons Effect (FPE), i.e. the production of excess power production during electrochemical loadingof deuterium in palladium (in the past labeled cold fusion) has had a notably multidisciplinary character, involving solid state andnuclear physics, material science, electrochemistry and other ﬁelds. Correlations between the material status and the occurrence ofthe effect as well as some changes in the electrochemical interface status have been observed. Although during the last two decades,in several calorimetric experiments the effect was observed to be well above the measurement uncertainty, the mechanism producingthe excess power is not completely understood. So far, the lack of reproducibility has been responsible for the absence of a clearexplanation of the phenomenon based on experimental apparatus designed to enhance the spectrum of information required todeﬁne the effect. Recently, In order to improve this aspect of this research, speciﬁc work has been carried out to investigate whetherthe excess power was produced concurrently with the emission of Radio Frequency from the active cathode. Suitable probesand triggering included in the RF experimental system revealed RF signal emission during electrochemical loading of palladiumsamples, and a correlation between the heat production, in active samples, and RF signal emission was found. The preliminaryresults highlight the importance of performing studies on the electrodynamic effects that may be involved in the phenomenon, andthe importance of the design of appropriate instruments designed to investigate unexplored regions of metal hydrogen systems.c/circlecopyrt2016 ISCMNS.
